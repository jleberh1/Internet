        <p style="font-size: 15px;"> The internet connects a wide range of devices such as Computers, Cell Phones, and Consoles. Routers and Redunancy help allow for packets which contain information to be sorted based off of size, and then trnsfered to the user based off of reliability, and connection speed. Protocols can allow for addresses like IP, which allow for where information should be sent to. The second protocol known as TCP breaks data into smaller packets to make sure there are no errors occuring. HTTPS is then used to request and display the pages that are being displayed, which are hosted on servers whihc store data and files. When researching a website DNS takes the https or www. and turns into a numerical IP address that the machine can read. Once these differant steps are carried out Data transfer can happen through the usage of Packets.
