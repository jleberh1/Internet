           <h1>This page contains information on Routers, Redundancy and Packets</h1>
            <h2 style="font-size: 20px;"> What are Routers? <br>
                <p style="font-size: 15px;"> Routers relay information from one network to another. Each router looks at the destination IP address and sends it based on the efficiency and reliability based upon paths. </p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 20px;"> What is Redundancy? <br>
                    <p style="font-size: 15px;"> Redundancy refers to the way the internet uses multiple paths ro switches to get information to users if there is more data condensed in one area. Redundancy can be used to also make the transfer of data through the internet more reliable if something may becomed hacked. </p>
                    <br> 
                    <h4 style="font-size: 20px;"> What are Packets? 
                        <p style="font-size: 15px;"> Packets are the collection of data being sent along with the address, the sequence number, and the protocol they are going to be used for. Packets are the basic unit of communication that is used in across the internet. Routers take and move packets and redundancy makes sure they are moved the fastest and most safe way to their destination. Thus allowing Routers, Redundancy, and Packets to contribute to how the internet works. </p>
